# About me

My name is Maya. I came in IT from Telecom, worked for Ukrainian cell operator [lifecell](https://www.lifecell.ua/en/) and for huge Swedish vendor [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). I decided to learn DevOps because it's a kind of challenge for me. Hope I'm strong enough to deal with it :)

## What I expect from this course
