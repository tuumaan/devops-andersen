* Learned a little about how git works, what is the difference between repository and branch. Also practiced with git commands.
* Realized that patience with the customers - it is a skill, it can be developed, just breathe deeply.
* The more I read articles and books about DevOps, the most I realize that this way is not so easy as I thought some time ago. But I like it :)
