* Learned a little about how git works, what is the difference between repository and branch. Also practiced with git commands.
* Realized that patience with the customers - it is a skill, it can be developed, just breathe deeply.
* The more I read articles and books about DevOps, the most I realize that this way is not so easy as I thought some time ago. But I like it :)

* Learned the new recipe - "Brownie-cheesecake with cherries". It is so yummy that I've eaten almost all the pie.
* Started to read docs about Flask. Looks not hard, need to practice 1-2 days with it
